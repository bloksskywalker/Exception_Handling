# Exception Handling

This program is a simple program with 1 java file. It is a calculator that does exception handling every step of the way.

It uses 2 inputs to calculate using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

If there are any errors while entering numbers, the program will ask for that number again. If there are any errors when solving the math equation, the program will skip solving that problem.

If any problem or number entered results in infinity or NaN the program will also catch that.
